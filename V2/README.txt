Creating the Builder for Big Data Small Places using the MEAN Stack. 
This was choosen because javascript is used in every part of the stack.
Angular, MongoDB, Express, and Node are all javascript frameworks.
This allows us to use only one language for the entire stack.

The builder will have a web user interface to customize and select 
the data categories that will be built into the app. This will allow people and companies
to add their chosen categories and optons to be built into their personalised
version of the app.
